Hi I’m João Carlos, new in Github and I really enjoy technology. Now I'm developing my coding skills
in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I'll want continue my studies with python, which I've already studied. And I intend to create some projects to increase 
my experience in programming and develop skills with Node.js and some frameworks like Express, React.js, etc.

See ya.
