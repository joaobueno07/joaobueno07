Hi Iâ€™m @joaobueno07, new in github and I really enjoy technology. Now I'm developing my coding skills
in Python and I'll learn other languages like JavaScript C++ and Java too. And I intend to create some projects to increase 
my experience in programming and develop my logical skills in programming. 

See ya.
